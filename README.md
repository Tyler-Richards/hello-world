# hello-world
This is my first of many repositories.
I am a neuroradiology fellow at the University of Utah in Salt Lake City. I am new to coding and have only taken a handful of introductory courses on Coursera. I am hoping to learn how to be an average coder in both 'R' and 'python' so that I can use those skills for running stats for my research papers and perform AI research, respectively.
